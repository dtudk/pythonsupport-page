Workshops -- Computational Thinking
===================================


The Python installation support provides introductory drop-in workshops
on computational thinking. They are aimed towards students following courses
in programming, and can help understand the logic behind program flow.

They can be a supplement to those students having difficulties following
the programming and/or using the following concepts.

.. grid:: 1 1 1 2
   :gutter: 1

   .. grid-item-card:: :fas:`x` -- Variables

      Understanding how variables gets (re-)assigned.
      A dive into lists and how they can be manipulated and
      reordered to ones liking.

   .. grid-item-card:: :fas:`not-equal` -- Conditionals

      Conditionals are used throughout :code:`if` statements
      to control program flow. There will be focus on how
      they influence the execution and how one should utilize
      them, critically.

   .. grid-item-card:: :fas:`repeat` -- Loops

      Understanding loops enables code flow that repeats
      sections; either a set number of times or repeated based
      on some criteria.

   .. grid-item-card:: :fas:`diagram-project` -- Functions

      Splitting code into functions can greatly ease understanding
      complex functions. Here focus will be on understanding
      how functions work and how they can aid in the program
      logic.
