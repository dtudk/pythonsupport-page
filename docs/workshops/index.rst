Workshops -- Computational Thinking
===================================


The Python installation support offers introductory drop-in workshops
focused on computational thinking.
These workshops are designed for students taking programming courses and aim
to help them understand the logic behind program flow.

They serve as a supplementary resource for students who may have
difficulties in using programming concepts.

   .. grid-item-card:: :fas:`x` -- Variables

      Understanding how variables are (re)assigned is crucial
      for effective programming.
      We will explore lists and how they can be manipulated and
      reordered.

   .. grid-item-card:: :fas:`not-equal` -- Conditionals

      Conditionals, such as :code:`if` statements, are essential for
      controlling program flow.
      We will focus on how they affect execution and how to use them
      efficiently.

   .. grid-item-card:: :fas:`repeat` -- Loops

      Understanding loops enables repetitive code execution,
      either for a specified number of times or
      based on specific criteria.

   .. grid-item-card:: :fas:`diagram-project` -- Functions

      Breaking code into functions can significantly improve the
      understanding of complex operations.
      This section will emphasize how functions work and how they can
      enhance program logic.
