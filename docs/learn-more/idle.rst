:guilabel:`IDLE` is an integrated development environment (IDE) installed automatically with Python.
It provides you with an environment where you can write Python scripts and run them or write Python code line by line to execute immediately.

:guilabel:`IDLE` is lightweight, simple, and great for introducing how to do coding projects. Therefore, it is well suited for beginners.


.. note::
   We only recommend introductory students to use IDLE while following :course-base:`02002`/:course-base:`02003`.

   :guilabel:`IDLE` is mainly useful for learning how to interact with Python scripts and snippets.
   More advanced IDE's will be introduced in many DTU courses.


Getting started
---------------


.. card::

   Open :guilabel:`IDLE`.

   .. tab-set::
      :sync-group: os

      .. tab-item:: {{ windows }}
         :sync: windows

         Open up a terminal (see :ref:`here <learn-more-open-terminal>`) and type, then press :kbd:`Enter`

         .. code:: pwsh

            idle

         You will see the following screen:

         .. image:: images/idle_windows1.png
            :width: 90%
            :align: center
            :alt: IDLE Shell


         The text you see indicates that you have opened a *Python Shell*. The lines starting with ">>>" are meant for Python code. Try typing or pasting in the following and press enter. 

         .. code:: python

            print("hello")

      .. tab-item:: {{ macos }}
         :sync: mac

         Open up a terminal (see :ref:`here <learn-more-open-terminal>`) and type, then press :kbd:`Enter`

         .. code:: bash

            idle3

         You will see the following screen:

         .. image:: images/idle_mac1.png
            :width: 90%
            :align: center
            :alt: IDLE Shell

         The text you see indicates that you have opened a *Python Shell*. The lines starting with ">>>" are meant for Python code. Try typing or pasting in the following and press enter. 

         .. code:: python
               
            print("hello")


Creating and running scripts
----------------------------

A Python *script* is a file with Python code. Once the script is *run*, all the code is executed.
This is great for larger jobs and allows for reuse of your code.

.. tab-set::
   :sync-group: os

   .. tab-item:: {{ windows }}
      :sync: windows

      #. Go to :menuselection:`File --> New File` in the IDLE menu to create a Python script. 

         .. image:: images/idle_windows2.png
            :width: 90%
            :align: center
            :alt: IDLE Shell

      #. You should see a blank page. Type or paste the following code 

         .. code:: python

            # This program is for adding 2 numbers

            # Declaring the variables
            num1 = 18
            num2 = 29

            # Doing the addition
            sum = num1 + num2

            # Printing the sum
            print(f"Sum of {num1} and {num2} equals {sum}")

         .. image:: images/idle_windows3.png
            :width: 90%
            :align: center
            :alt: IDLE Shell

      #. Go to :menuselection:`File --> Save As` and save the script as ``sum.py``

         .. image:: images/idle_windows4.png
            :width: 90%
            :align: center
            :alt: IDLE Shell

      #. Run the script.
         In the top menu, go to :menuselection:`Run --> Run Module` (or press :kbd:`F5`).
         You should now see some output. 


   .. tab-item:: {{ macos }}
      :sync: mac

      #. Go to :menuselection:`File --> New File` in the IDLE menu to create a Python script.

         .. image:: images/idle_mac2.png
            :width: 90%
            :align: center
            :alt: IDLE Shell

      #. You should see a blank page. Type or paste the following code 

         .. code:: python

            # This program is for adding 2 numbers

            # Declaring the variables
            num1 = 18
            num2 = 29

            # Doing the addition
            sum = num1 + num2

            # Printing the sum
            print(f"Sum of {num1} and {num2} equals {sum}")

         .. image:: images/idle_mac3.png
            :width: 90%
            :align: center
            :alt: IDLE Shell

      #. Go to :menuselection:`File --> Save As` and save the script as ``sum.py``

         .. image:: images/idle_mac4.png
            :width: 90%
            :align: center
            :alt: IDLE Shell

      #. Run the script.
         In the top menu, go to :menuselection:`Run --> Run Module` (or press :kbd:`F5`).
         You should now see some output.


You can now modify and run the script as much as you want.

As mentioned, :guilabel:`IDLE` is best suited for simple projects. Later during the 1\ :sup:`st` semester
you will be introduced to :ref:`Visual Studio Code <learn-more.vscode>`.
