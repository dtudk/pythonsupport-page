Visual Studio Code
===================

Similarly to :doc:`IDLE <../idle>`, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a place to write your Python code.
VS Code is built for large projects.
It is useful for, but not limited to, debugging, organizing files, and collaborating on code with others.
It also comes with extensions that can improve visual clarity, help you collaborate with
others and a particularly useful type of file called Jupyter Notebooks.

We have created some tutorials that will introduce you to different type of files and workflows:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   python-script
   jupyter-notebooks


.. note::

   Visual Studio Code will be gradually introduced if you are in your 1\ :sup:`st` semester.
   You can return here later if needed.
   Remember that this page is here to get you started with some basic tips whenever needed.
