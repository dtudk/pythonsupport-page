Visual Studio Code
===================

Similarly to IDLE, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a place to write your Python code. VS Code is great for larger projects.
It is useful for things like debugging, organizing files and collaborating with other people for coding.
It also comes with extensions that can improve visual clarity, help you collaborate with 
others and a particularly useful type of file called Jupyter notebooks. 

We have created two tutorials that will introduce you to two different type of files and workflows:

.. toctree:: 
   :maxdepth: 1
   
   python-script
   jupyter-notebooks


.. note::
   
   If you are in your 1\ :sup:`st` semester, VS Code will be gradually introduced.
   You can return here later if needed.
   Just remember that this page is here to get you started with some basic tips whenever you need.
