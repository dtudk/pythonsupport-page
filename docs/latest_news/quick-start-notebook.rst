Quick Start Jupyter Notebook
===================================

Description
-----------------------------------


This page gives a quick start guide to using Jupyter Notebooks for programming in Python, including installation instructions and basic usage tips. 

Guide
------
**Step 1: Create a Jupyter Notebook**
- Open VSCode.
- Hold `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac) to open the command palette.
- Type "Create: New Jupyter Notebook" and select it.
- A new notebook will open in a new tab.

**Step 2: Select Python Kernel**
- In the top right corner of the notebook, click on "Select Kernel".
- Choose the appropriate Python environment. For first year DTU students, select the environment named `Base(Python 3.12.XX)`.
- If you do not see the correct environment follow ref`this <common-issues-fall25>` link to troubleshoot.

**Step 3: Write and Run Code Cells**
- If you are already in a notebook from a course, navigate to the top middle and press `Run All`. 
- Otherwise click on the first cell and type your Python code.
- To run a cell, press `Shift + Enter` or click the "Run" button in the toolbar.

**Step 4: Writing Text**
- The jupyter notebook has Markdown cells which are used to write text.
- To create a markdown cell hover below an existing cell and click the `Markdown` button.
- To write mathematical equations and so on you can use the Markdown or LaTeX syntax.
- To render the markdown cell, press `Shift + Enter` just as a code cell.
