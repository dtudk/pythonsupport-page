This guide will help you uninstall Conda from your computer. This can be useful if:

* You are trying to install packages with :ref:`pip`, but cannot import the package.

* You already have the Anaconda distribution installed, but need to switch to miniconda.

1. Ensure all shells, command prompts are closed i.e. make sure no files related to Anaconda/Miniconda are open anywhere.  

2. Open your control panel, and press :guilabel:`Uninstall application`.

3. Please find all the applications regarding Anaconda (and Miniconda), right click on them and press :guilabel:`Uninstall`.


{{ macos }} and Linux
-------------------------------------------

* If you have installed Miniconda through Homebrew, run the following command line in the terminal:

  .. code:: bash
       
     brew remove miniconda

  .. tip::
      
     If you are unsure how you installed Miniconda, you can check by running the following command in your terminal. If the command returns ``miniconda``, it confirms that it was installed via Homebrew:
      
     .. code:: bash
      
        brew list | grep miniconda
      

* If you did not install Miniconda through Homebrew, you can remove it by running the following commands in your terminal:

  .. code:: bash
     
     conda activate
     conda init --reverse --all
     cd
     sudo rm -rf ~/miniconda3
     sudo rm -rf /opt/miniconda3


      

* If you want to uninstall Anaconda, run the following commands in your terminal:

  .. code:: bash
      
     
     conda activate
     conda init --reverse --all
     cd
     sudo rm -rf ~/anaconda3
     sudo rm -rf /opt/anaconda3
