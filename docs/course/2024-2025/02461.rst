This guideline is for students attending course :course-base:`2024:02461` in the E24 year.

The course requires:

* A working Python (can be installed :ref:`here <install-python>`)
* A working VS Code (is installed by following :ref:`these guides <install-python>`)

Choose one of these installation procedures:

.. card:: Semi-manual installation

   Download the :download:`02461.yml </course/2024-2025/02461.yml>` and install
   it using :ref:`this environment.yml guide <learn-more-environments-yaml>`.

   This will create an environment named ``IntelligentSystems`` that you should
   activate when following the course.


.. card:: Fully-manual installation

   We recommend you to create an :ref:`environment <learn-more-environments>` for this course:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda config --add channels conda-forge
      conda create --name IntelligentSystems

   Every time you need to run code in the course, you need to activate the environment:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda activate IntelligentSystems

   The required packages should be installed in the above environment,
   and can be done by executing these commands, one by one:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda activate IntelligentSystems
      conda config --env --add channels pytorch
      conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio matplotlib opencv imageio scikit-learn scikit-image jupyter pygame scipy nltk ipywidgets tqdm
