============================================================================

This guideline is for students attending course :course-base:`2023:02461` in the E23 year.

The course requires:

* A working Python (can be install :ref:`here <install-python>`)
* A working VS Code (is installed by following :ref:`these guides <install-python>`)

Ensure you have Python installed by following :ref:`this guide <install-python>`.
Note this will install Python using ``conda``.

We recommend you to create an :ref:`environment <learn-more-environments>` for this course:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda config --add channels conda-forge
   conda create --name IntelligentSystems python=3.11 -y

Every time you need to run code in the course, you need to activate the environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda activate IntelligentSystems

The required packages should be installed in the above environment,
and can be done by executing this command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio matplotlib opencv-python imageio scikit-learn scikit-image jupyter pygame scipy nltk ipywidgets tqdm
