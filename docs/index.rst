DTU Python Installation Support
===============================



Welcome to the DTU Python Installation student support unit!  
We are here to help you with Python installation problems related
to courses at DTU.

Our goal is to ensure that students can get a Python
environment up and running according to the needs of DTU courses.  
Help can be requested through various channels:
